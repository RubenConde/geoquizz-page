# About GéoQuizz

GéoQuizz started in a school project, the main idea was to create a game in which the player could choose between different locations and then appear to him sites of interest of the place he chose to locate these on the map and thus earn points.

GéoQuizz was created with the framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) using its own [API](https://rubenconde.github.io/geoquizzAPI/) to manage the data it displays and generates and using [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) as visual style.

GéoQuizz has a [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), so its code can be used as a base for other projects without any problem.
